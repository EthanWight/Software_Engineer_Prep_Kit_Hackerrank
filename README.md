# HackerRank Software Engineer Prep Kit in Python

This repository is dedicated to my personal practice and solutions for the Software Engineer Prep Kit on HackerRank. All solutions are implemented in Python 3.

## About This Kit

The HackerRank Software Engineer Prep Kit is a curated collection of challenges designed to help users prepare for software engineering interviews. This repository serves as a log of my progress and a reference for my solutions.

## Contents

This repository is structured to follow the modules within the HackerRank Prep Kit. Currently, it includes:

* **Arrays and Basic Problem Solving**: Solutions and explorations of array-based challenges and fundamental problem-solving techniques can be found in the `Arrays and Basic Problem Solving.ipynb` notebook.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions, you can clone this repository and navigate through the files. For the Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to have a Python environment with Jupyter installed.
